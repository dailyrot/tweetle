# Tweetle Puzzle Design Guidelines

## Tweet Selection Criteria

1. **No identity giveaways** - Remove tweets that mention the author's name, brand, or signature product (no "Tesla", "Elongate", "covfefe", "Yeezy", etc.). If someone can identify the author from a single keyword, it's too easy.

2. **Cross-wire energy** - Every tweet should plausibly sound like at least one other candidate. The best tweets are ones where the "obvious" guess is wrong:
   - Trump doing celebrity gossip (sounds like Kim)
   - Kanye being philosophical about simulations (sounds like Elon)
   - Elon being self-deprecating (sounds like Kanye)
   - 50 Cent telling absurd stories (sounds like Kanye)
   - Trump's meta-humor about twitter (sounds like Elon)

3. **Candidate selection matters** - The 4 candidates in each puzzle should be chosen so the decoy (who the tweet *sounds* like) is always present. If a Trump tweet sounds like Kim gossip, Kim must be a candidate.

4. **No viral freebies** - Avoid universally-known tweets that have been memed to death (covfefe, "Ima fix wolves", etc.)

5. **Funny or unhinged > generic** - Every tweet should make you laugh or say "what the fuck." No boring promotional tweets or generic motivational quotes.

6. **Difficulty curve within each puzzle** - Ideally each puzzle has a mix: one that's genuinely hard, one that's medium, and one that rewards knowledge of the person's specific style.

## Puzzle Structure Rules

- 4 candidates per puzzle, 3 rounds
- Each round's answer must be a different author
- Authors should appear across puzzles in varied combinations, not always the same 4
